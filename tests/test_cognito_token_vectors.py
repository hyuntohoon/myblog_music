"""Signed-token vectors for `verify_token` — the surface no test reached before.

The 40 auth tests that existed on 2026-08-26 all avoided constructing a JWT:
they passed `credentials=None`, a literal `"x.y.z"`, or monkeypatched the
verifier away. So every property below — signature, issuer, `token_use`,
expiry, `nbf`, the RS256 pin, the app-client binding — was unverified, and a
refactor that turned any of them into a no-op would have gone unnoticed. That
is not hypothetical: `token_use in ("access", "id")` advertises ID-token
support that has never worked, because `jwt.decode` is called without
`audience=` and jose rejects any token carrying `aud`. `test_id_token_*` below
pins that so the dead branch cannot be "fixed" into a real hole by someone
passing `audience=` and concluding it works because access tokens still pass.

This is the `myblog_music` copy of the backend vectors (minus the owner tiers
music does not have, and calling `require_cognito_token` because music has no
factored-out `verify_token`). The guards are duplicated on purpose; their vectors
must be too, or the copies drift where the duplication exists to protect.

This matters more here than in the backend: `infra/apigateway.tf` attaches the
Cognito authorizer to 51 of 55 routes and to NONE of `/api/music/*`, so for this
service the in-process guard is the only gate there is.
